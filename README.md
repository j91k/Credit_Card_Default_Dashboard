# Credit Card Default Dashboard and EDA

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main components: an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and an interactive dashboard. We analyzed credit card usage patterns, payment behaviors, and default risks using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The analysis covers default payments, late payments, demographic factors, credit data, payment history, and bill statements of credit card clients.

## Features

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data extraction and cleaning
- Statistical analysis of credit card usage patterns
- Correlation studies between various factors and default/late payments
- Correlation between credit utilization ratio with various factors
- Visualization of key trends and insights

### Interactive Dashboard
- Late Payment Analysis
- Buying Pattern Behavior Visualization
- Demographic Insights
- Credit Utilization Ratio Examination

## Data Source

The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's "Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset", containing information on 30,000 credit card clients in Taiwan.

## Project Components

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Data Extraction**: Importing and initial processing of the dataset
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies
- **Statistical Analysis**: Descriptive statistics, distribution analysis, correlation studies
- **Data Visualization**: Creating informative plots and charts for key insights

### 2. Interactive Dashboard
- Dynamic visualizations of EDA findings
- Filtering options for data segmentation
- Summary statistics and key metrics display

## Technologies Used

- **Data Processing and Analysis**: 
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
- **Data Visualization**: 
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn (for EDA)
  - D3.js (for interactive dashboard visualizations)
- **Frontend Development**:
